Data Analysis based on AdventureWorks database.

## Leave-Bonus.ipynb

The purpose of this report is to analyze the relationship between annual leave and bonuses for employees, using data from the AdventureWorks2019 database. The objective is to provide stakeholders with insights into how annual leave allocation impacts bonus payments.

**Analysis:**

This analysis involved querying the AdventureWorks2019 database to retrieve data on annual leave and bonuses. 

**Results:**

The analysis found a strong correlation between vacation hours and bonuses that employees receive. From this we can conclude that vacation hours have a positive effect on the performance of employees, as well as on their bonuses paid for work. Employees who have minimum vacation hours either receive no bonuses at all or receive very few bonuses. There is also an inverse correlation - people who rest more are more motivated to work and to do it in less time, bringing profit to the company and receiving bonuses.
 
**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between annual leave and bonus payments. The analysis clearly advises the company to evaluate its vacation hours policy, since the relationship between performance and bonuses is quite strong. This will also help improve employee motivation and the quality of their work.Further investigations and adjustments based on these findings can contribute to the overall success and well-being of the workforce.

## Stores-Employees-Revenue.ipynb

This report aims to investigate the relationship between the size of stores, the number of employees, and revenue. By analyzing these variables, we seek to understand how store size and staffing levels impact revenue generation in retail establishments. 

**Analysis:**

Store Size and Revenue:
Upon conducting the analysis, a very strong correlation is observed between the size of the stores and their revenue.
This correlation suggests that there is a direct relationship between store size and revenue, indicating that larger stores have the capacity to accommodate more products, attract more customers, and ultimately drive higher sales volumes.
 
**Number of Employees and Revenue:**

Similarly, a strong correlation is found between the number of employees and revenue. Stores with a greater number of employees tend to achieve higher revenue figures.
This correlation implies that having more employees enables stores to provide better customer service, maintain adequate inventory levels, and effectively manage operations, all of which contribute to increased sales and revenue.
 
**Combined Analysis:**

When considering all three variables together, i.e., store size, number of employees, and revenue, a consistent pattern emerges. Larger stores with more employees tend to generate the highest revenue.
This indicates that there is a synergistic effect between store size and staffing levels, with both factors working together to drive revenue growth. Larger stores require more employees to handle operations effectively, leading to enhanced customer experiences and greater revenue opportunities.
 
**Conclusion:**

To put it simply, the analysis shows that bigger stores with more employees tend to make more money. This means that investing in making stores larger and hiring more staff can help businesses earn more profit. Understanding this link is crucial for retailers to make smart decisions about how they run their stores, where they put their money, and how they can make the most sales. Exploring other factors like where stores are located, what they sell, and how they advertise could also give businesses more clues about how to make even more money.
